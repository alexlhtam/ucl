# recursion

## introduction
- sometimes not easy to define anobject explicitly, but it is relatively easier to define an object in terms of itself:
  - 0 is a natural number;
  - the successor of a natural number is also a natural number
- the definition of an object in terms of itself is called a recursive definition
- recursion is commonly used to define:
  - functions
  - sequences
  - sets
  - algorithms

## recursive definition of a function
- a recursive definition of a function with domain in the non-negative integers has two parts:
  - base step
    - the value of the function at 0, or the least element of the domain, is specified
  - recursive step:
    - a rule is given to find the value of the function at any integer based on the values of the function at smaller integers

### a well known recursive function
- Fibonacci sequence:
$$
\begin{cases}
f(0) = 1\\
f(1) = 1\\
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), n \geq 2
\end{cases}
$$

### other example
- let the sequence ${a_n}, n = 1, 2, 3,...$ be defined explicitly as $$a_n = n^2 + 3n$$
- first, determine $a_1$:
  - $a_1 = 1^2 + 3 \cdot 1 = 4$
- now determine $a_{n+1}$ for $n \geq 1$:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  a_{n+1} &= (n+1)^2 + 3(n+1) \\
          &= n^2 + 2n + 1 + 3n + 3 \\
          &= (n^2 + 3n) + 2n + 4 \\
          &= a_n + 2n + 4
  \end{aligned}
  $$
- hence:
$$
\begin{cases}
a_1 = 4,\\
a_{n+1} = a_n + 2n + 4, \text{for } n \geq 1
\end{cases}
$$

## recursive definition of sets
- a recursive definition of a set has two parts:
  - base step:
    - specify an initial collection of objects that belong to the set
  - recursive step: 
    - specify rules to form new elements from the elements already in the set
  - exclusion rule:
    - elements that cannot be generated by applying the base step and instances of the recursive step DO NOT belong to the set
$$
\text{let the set } S \text{ be defined as:} \\
\begin{cases}
3 \in S, \\
\text{if } x \in S \text{ and } y \in S, \text{ then } x + y \in S.
\end{cases}
$$

- many problems deal with words, or strings, formed from an alphabet
- the set of $\Sigma'$ of strings over an alphabet $\Sigma$ can be defined recursively as:
  - base step: $\lambda \in \Sigma'$ (where $\lambda$ represents the empty string, with no symbols) 
  - recursive step: if $w \in \Sigma'$ and $x \in \Sigma$ then $wx \in \Sigma'$ 
    - where $wx$ represents the string formed by concatenating the symbol $x$ at the end of the prefix $w$

- the set of well formed propositional formulas can be defined recursively as:
  - base step: $\bot,\top$ and $s$ are well-formed formulas, where $s$ represents a logical proposition
  - recursive step: if $G$ and $H$ are well-formed formulas, then $(\neg G), (G \land H), (G \lor H), (G \longrightarrow H) \text{ and } (G \longleftrightarrow H)$ are well-formed formulas

## lists and trees
### lists
- a list over set $A$ is defined inductively by:
  - base step: `[]` is a list
  - recursive step: if $x \in A$ and $xs$ is a list, then $x :: xs$ is a list

### trees
- a tree is a hierarchical data structure made of connected nodes with no cycles:
  - root node;
  - nodes can have multiple children but only one parent (except for the root);
  - leaves - nodes with no children

### binary trees
- a binary tree is a tree in which each nodes except for the leaves has exactly two child nodes
  - a binary tree can be defined recursively as:
    - base step: 
      - an isolated vertex is a binary tree
    - recursive step:
      - if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are disjoint binary trees with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, respectively, then we can form a new tree by connecting to a vertex $r$ (not present in $T_1$ or $T_2$) with an edge to $r_1$ and another to $r_2$

# structural induction
- if a set has a recursive definition, it is possible to prove properties of the elements of this set using induction
- structural induction is a way to show that if:
  1) the initial elements of the set (base step) satisfy a certain property, and
  2) the rules for constructing new elements (inductive step) preserve this proerty
  then all elements of the set satisfy the property
- the proof of structural induction has two parts:
  - base step:
    - show that the proposition holds for all elements specified in the base step of the recursive definition of the set
  - inductive step:
    - show that if the proposition holds for each of the elements used to construct new elements of the set, then the proposition also holds for these new elements
  the induction hypothesis is that the proposition holds for each of the elements used to construct new elements of the set
