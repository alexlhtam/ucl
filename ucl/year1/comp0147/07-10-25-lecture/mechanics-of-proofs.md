# the mechanics of proofs
## write proofs in two ways:
- in words, as humans have done for thousands of years
- in a proof assistant
- formalise mathematics: express mathematical reasoning within a formal logical system
  - clarity and precision: forces every assumption and inference to be explicit; eliminate ambiguity
  - foundations of truth: explores how truths depend on axioms and inference rules
  - mechanical verification
  - bridging maths and computation
