## q1 [M]
if $m+n$ is even, rewrite $m+n=2a$, and $n+p=2b$

then rearrange $m+n=2a$ for $m$, giving us $$m = 2a - n$$ and similarly for $p$: $$p =2b - n$$

therefore $ m + p = (2a-n) + (2b-n) = 2(a+b-n)$

since $a$, $b$ and $n$ are all integers, $a+b-n$ must also be an integer. 

therefore, $m+p$ must be even by direct proof

## q2 [M]
let $x$ and $y$ be the two odd numbers respectively

since $x$ and $y$ are both odd, there exist some numbers $k$ and $j$ such that $$x = 2k + 1 \newline y=2j+1$$

therefore, \begin{align}
x \times y &= (2k+1)(2j+1) \\
&= 2kj + 2k + 2j + 1
\end{align}
