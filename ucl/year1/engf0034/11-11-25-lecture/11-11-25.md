# tetris advice
## algorithm for `choose_action()`
- for all possible positions (columns)
  - for all posible target rotations
    - clone the board (sandbox)
    - execute a sequence of moves to "move towards target"
    - once the target is reached and the block lands, score the board
given a targetposition (x coord) and target rotation, perform successive moves until the target is reached and the block lands
should we rotate first then move? or move first and then rotate

target state strategy to explore all 40 landing possibilites efficiently
how do we score the resulting board?
- convert a board position into numerical score that reflcets how "good" or "bad" a position is
  
height, remaining blocks, holes

need to write an algorithm that quantify these features and combine them into a single score

landed blocks, board.cells
- python set 
- contains (x,y) cords of all blocks landed
