# what is a Java Record?
- added in Java 16
- class specialised for representing data objects
  - object is used as a collection of fields (instance vars), bit like a C struct
  - doesn't require additional methods but can be added
  - shallowly immutable
- provides a compact syntax for declaring record classes

# Book example
```java
public record Book (String title, String author, int pages) {}
```
- the fields (`type`, `name`) are listed in the parentheses
- nothing in the braces
- objects created in the usual way:
  ```java
    Book book = new Book("title", "name", 200);
  ```

# Records
- are final classes, cannot be subclassed (even if not declared using final)
- have a fixed number of fields (final instance variables) when declared
  - fields cannot be modified by assignment once initialised
- cannot extend a class, but can implement interfaces
- can be generic

# boilerplate code
- fully useable data objects need:
  - getters for fields (not setters)
  - an equals method to compare object values
  - `hashCode` method to generate the hash for the object value
    - needed for data structures to be able to store and compare values correctly
  - `toString` to return a string representing a value
    - override the default
  - all generated automatically
    - would have to write these manually otherwise, or use IDE to generate them

# accessing fields
```java
String title = book.title();
int pages = book.pages();
```
- a getter method is added with the same name ofr each field
  - doesn't use the `get_<name>` convention
- fields are final (instance variables)
  - cannot be changed by assignment
- there are no other fields, the state of the object is the values of the fields

# adding methods
```java
public record Book (String title, String author, int pages) {
    public boolean isLongBook() {
        return pages > 250;
    }
}
```
- remember that fields are final, so cannot assign a value:
  - `pages += 100; //error`

# equals
- compares object values, not references
- programmer decides what is actually compared to determine if object values are equal
  - all instance vars?
  - a `Person`'s name?
  - computed values?
- handle `null` values
- shallow or deep?

# Hash Code
- a fixed-size numerical value generated by a hash function
  - map a value, such as object value, to a number
- ideally, all distinct object values map to a unique hash code
<br>
- allows efficient storage and access in a range of data structures
  - `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `LinkedHashMap` and others
- a properly constructed Java class should override `hashCode`, if the objects are to be stored in any data structure that uses `hashCode`
- a default method is provided by `Object`
  - it only takes into account object identity (reference), not value
