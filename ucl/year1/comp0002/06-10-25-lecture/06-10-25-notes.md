# memory
## RAM: random access memory
-   or DRAM, Dynamic Random Access memory
    - DDR1/2/3/4/5, GDDR, others
    - SRAM, static RAM, fast but expensive
- volatile (contents lost when not powered)
- stores currently running code and data (OS applications)
- fast access (read/write cycles)

## cache memory
- very fast and temporarily store data for quick access
- multi level: processor core caches, shared caches, main memory cache
- expensive, limited capacity
- reduces need to access slower main RAM
- need to reload on context changes, e.g. thread/process switch
- entirely managed by hardware, no programmer access

## memory hierarchy
cpu registers -> cpu cache -> memory cache -> physical/virtual ram -> storage devices

fast access to slow access, only storage devices are non-volatile storage

# object files
- called .o files on Unix, .obj on Windows
- usuaully each .c file is compiled to a .o file with the same name
  - compilation assumes the virtual memory address space layout
- will contain relocatable binary code
  - speicifc virtual memory addresses not resolved until linking
  - does not require fixed memory addresses
- processor and operating system specific
  - recompile the source code for a different system

# dynamic linking
- linking is done at runtime as functions in libraries are called
  - avoid needing to include the libraries in every executable program file
  - static linking would combine all code into a single executable but is no longer widely used or even supported

# imperative programming languages
- vs functional programming languages (a different programming model)
## basic control constructs
- sequence
- selection
- iteration
