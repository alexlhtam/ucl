# C
- long established **procedural** language
	- structured approach
	- functions, procedures
- high portability
	- adapts to different platforms
- speed and efficiency
	- low level memory manipulation
	- high performance
- standardised
	- ANSI C/ISO C standards for consistency
	- C23 is most recent
- rich libraries
	- extensive libraries for various tasks
- system development
	- used for OS dev, embedded systems, drivers
# C++
- evolution of C adding support for OOP
- used for application development
- big, complex, language, also standardised
- mostly upwardly compatible with a large subset of C23

# C v other languages
- C programs run in machine code directly on underlying hardware
- direct access to memory
- .py, .java, .js, Haskell programs run in virtual/simulated envs which run on hardware
	- no access to memory
	- ALL implemented in C/C++!
	- abstracted from hardware
- low v high level languages
