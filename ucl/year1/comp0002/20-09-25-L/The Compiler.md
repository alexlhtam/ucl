- does the source code to processor instruction translation (machine language)
- knows and checks all the **syntax rules** but only some of the *semantics*
- the compiler is itself a program
	- most C compilers are written in C (or C++)
- comp0002 uses GCC
	- gcc.gnu.org
	- the gnu compiler collection
	- open source software
- or clang for MacOS
	- clang.livm.org
	- also open source
	- on MacOS, gcc is aliased to clang
# Compiler Process
- phases:
	- tokenisation
	- parsing and grammar checking
	- type checking
	- code generation
- if anything is wrong, you see error messages
- the generated code is *machine code*
	- specific to processor
- the example is complied with:
	- gcc example.c
