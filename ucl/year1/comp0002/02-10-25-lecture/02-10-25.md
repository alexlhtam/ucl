# Include
- an include directive textually includes the contents of another file
- h files
    - `graphic.h`
    - `<stdio.h>`
    - `<stdlib.h>`
- .h files contain declarations
    - names of functions and other elements needed
    - but not the actual code implementing the functions

- standard libaries
    - stdout is standard output
    - stdin is standard input

# Permissions
- all files and directories have permissions
    - who can access the file (owner/group/everyone)
    - is the file executable?
    - is the file actually a dir?

- in the Unix world an executable file/program can be run if it has execute permission
    - the file name is irrelevant

- in Windows, it is simliar excpt that the file will be named `house.exe`, but acn be run just using house
    - e.g. `gcc` is really `gcc.exe`

# Paths
- a path is the location of a file/dir in the filestore (disk drive)
- a path can be **absolute** (exact location)
    - `/Users/alex/CProgramming/Ex1/hello.c`
    - `C:\Users\alex\CProgramming\Ex1\hello.c`
- a path can be **relative** (to the current dir)
- it is a good practice to **always use relative paths**

# Path Environment Variable
- to run a program the *shell* must find it
    - remember we are working from the command line in a terminal
- the shell has a list of directories to look in: the PATH environment variable
    - `echo $path` (Unix, case sensisitive, some shells such as zsh appear to be case sensitive but really are not)
    - `echo %PATH%` (windows command prompt, case insensitive)
    - `$Env:PATH` (powershell)
